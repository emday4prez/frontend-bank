### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
-   [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - UI Foundation

### What I learned

I learned a lot about forms and validation in React. I also used a lot of conditional rendering to display notifications.

### Continued development

This project is only addresses the front end. In the future I would like to connect it to a back end and provide more functionality.
