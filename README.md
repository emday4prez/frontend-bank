### Built with

### Features

This projects utilizes the native `useState` and `useContext` features provided by React. Users can create a new account, withdraw and deposit 'money', as well as view all of the data stored. 

### What I learned

I learned a lot about forms and validation in React. I also used a lot of conditional rendering to display notifications.

### Continued development

This project is only addresses the front end. In the future I would like to connect it to a back end and provide more functionality.
